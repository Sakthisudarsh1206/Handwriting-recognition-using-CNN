Handwriting Detection with CNN
Overview
This project aims to develop a handwriting detection model to recognize handwritten English text from scanned forms. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset, which contains forms of unconstrained handwritten text scanned at 300dpi and saved as PNG images with 256 gray levels.

Dataset
The IAM Handwritten Forms Dataset is partitioned into directories, with each directory containing forms written by the same individual. The dataset provides a diverse collection of handwritten text samples suitable for training and evaluating handwriting recognition models.

Model Architecture
The handwriting detection model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Dropout regularization is applied to mitigate overfitting, and batch normalization is used to stabilize training.
